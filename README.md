# 🛡️ Advanced Python Keylogger with GUI Viewer

**For Ethical Hacking, Security Research, and Digital Forensics**  
Built with Python on **Kali Linux** 🐍💻  

---

## 📌 Description

This project is a Python-based **keylogger and system monitoring tool** designed strictly for **ethical security research and forensic analysis**. It includes:

- **Keystroke Logging** with timestamping  
- **Clipboard Monitoring**  
- **Periodic Screenshot Capture**  
- **Encryption of All Logs** using Fernet (AES-based symmetric encryption)  
- **Tkinter GUI Viewer** to decrypt and view logs and screenshots interactively

> ✅ _Developed in a controlled environment for research purposes only._
